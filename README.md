# HCI-Assignment By Matthew Goehner
This is a course app to allow students to see the courses they are enrolled in, upcoming assignments, group chats a calendar, and notifications

The top 5 new functionalities that I have not seen in any apps are

1.Access to quizes and other features from within app 

2.Ability to access discussion boards and post to them from the app

3.Ability for instructors to add new course content from within the app

4.App ui customization

5.Ability to set reminders for assignments
